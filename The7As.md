These 7A include:

**Agile**: A Mindset. Starting off with good framework, what works and what doesn't. Map out what works and what doesn't.

**Authentic**: The shareability of a voice, i.e., a great writing voice. Value driven business, real writing voice, you being a creator

**Attention**: Attraction or attention. It's about headlines, hooks, meaning and fascination. Relationships to gain traffic and attention. Attention needs to be captured and attention and begins with either social or search and then it's on a domain that you control. 

Ask yourself: who's attention are you capturing?

Social media should be used to make secure relationships and grow business. It should not be _the business_.

**Authority**: Being an expert on your field, but the expertise must be expressed in a humanistic way.

**Action**: Writing that persuades. Make a purchase, take a political action, make a donation, etc. You may have to work with a dedicated specialist. So, your client or your organization may be working with an ad agency with a dedicated direct response copywriter. And sometimes, probably more often, it's going to be up to you to make this happen.

**Acceleration**: Make connections to everyone, because you never know when you're going to who is or isn't going to help you in the future. Networking is the key to all businesses.
